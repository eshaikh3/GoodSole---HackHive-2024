# hackhive2024 Team 25 -- Good Sole

## Run Instructions
Ensure the db.env, cacert.pem, and app.py files are all within the same folder.  The Flask API can be started by running the app.py file.  This will launch it on a localhost server (URI placed in the terminal after successful start)

### Inspiration
Our solution is built for small business owners wanting to venture into economical and effective cloud-based inventory management systems. Our application was designed to optimize their point-of-sale systems and take a step towards dynamic cloud-based systems. We used Azure cloud for hosting our web app and the Azure PostgreSQL flexible server.

### What it does
Our retail inventory program efficiently manages stock levels, and provides transaction insights for barcode-based product identification, and incorporates customizable search options for customer preferences. This ensures users access quality and affordable products tailored to their search criteria when seeking employee assistance. A web based application allows for cross-compatibility with a variety of different devices and hardware setups.

### How we built it
Our application is a python-based dynamic web application.  It is a flask web app linked with a  PostgreSQL database.  This database contains generated user, inventory, and transaction history details for analytics.

### Challenges we ran into
Cloud integration is way harder than we thought it would be! We had to pivot last minute (3 hours to deadline!) to try to have an effective project.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team came from a wide variety of backgrounds, so our collaboration ensured everyone had an opportunity to participate.  Everyone was able to contribute positively to a fun development piece!

### What we learned
Our team entered this project with minimal web development and flask knowledge.  We had absolutely no knowledge of Azure services and their capabilities.  We learned the difficulties of integrating with Azure and general web development, and provided an introduction to the different abilities of Python through Flask!

### What's next for GoodSole
Future developments will include more accurate and a wider variety of analytics based on the transaction history table.  Due to the short development period, further user testing is required to bring this application to production.
